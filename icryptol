# Driver script for the icryptol notebook interface. This is a thin
# wrapper around the ipython command line interface, and will in fact
# forward along any arguments to the invocation of `ipython notebook`.
#
# This script attempts to be location-agnostic but currently assumes a
# POSIX layout for the installation of the icryptol-kernel executable
# and the profile.tar that contains the basic cryptol profile for
# IPython. By setting the IPYTHONDIR environment variable, you can
# control where this profile is created (if not set it will be in
# $HOME/.ipython).

IPYTHONDIR=${IPYTHONDIR:-$HOME/.ipython}
